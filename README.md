# What this is

A fork of Facebook Research's [ParlAI](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI) chatbot that exposes an API for encoding and decoding secret messages within innocent-looking conversations.

This fork is currently based off of ParlAI `v0.9.3` tag on Github.

# How to use

## Dependencies

This project requires all the same dependencies as the version of ParlAI it is based on, no more or less. I recommend checking the guide in their `README.md` file.

## API

You'll find the full API in `parlai/scripts/steganography_api.py`, and example usage in `parlai/scripts/steganography_api_test.py`.
